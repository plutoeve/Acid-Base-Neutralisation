# Acid-Base Neutralisation

<table>
<tr>
<td>
This chemistry, application involves the concept of Acid-Base Titration. It is the process of
neutralizing an acid with a base or vice versa, which would then result into a product that is
composed of water (H20) and salt.
</td>
<td>
The main basis of Acid-Base Titration is that for the acid/base, it's that the acid's
concentration multiplied by its volume will be equals to the base's concentration times its
volume, so in the end they both cancel out and become neutral
